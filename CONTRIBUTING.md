# Contributing to rsbio-seq project

We love to have your contributions to the rsbio-seq project, whether it's:
* Reporting a bug
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new features

## Clone and install rsbio-seq onto your machine

First, make sure you have [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) and [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your machine.

On GitHub, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the rsbio-seq repository and [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) it to your machine.

```shell
# clone repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/anuradhawick/rsbio-seq.git
```

Move to the rsbio-seq directory 

```shell
cd rsbio-seq
```

Now build rsbio-seq using cargo. Make sure to have [`rust`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) installed.

```shell
cargo build
```

## Test rsbio-seq build

Use the following command to test the build. All tests should pass.

```shell
cargo test
```

## Coding Style

We use [Clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/) to lint code in rsbio-seq.

Before committing, make sure to run Clippy as follows.

```shell
cargo clippy
```

## Report bugs using GitHub's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue in GitHub [issues](https://github.com/anuradhawick/rsbio-seq/issues). You will get to select between templates for bug reports and feature requests. If none of these templates matches what you want to report, you can use the custom issue template.

## Committing code

Once you have finished coding and all the tests pass, commit your code and make a pull request. 

```bash
# Add changed/added files
git add <file name>

# Commit changes
git commit -m "<commit message>"

# Push changes
git push
```
